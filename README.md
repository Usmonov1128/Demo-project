This is a simple online store primarily built using Node.js. Key functionalities include adding, updating, and deleting products, as well as viewing product details. Each user can only manage their own products, meaning:

You cannot delete or modify products added by another user.
Other users also cannot delete or modify the products youâ€™ve added.
The application is developed using Node.js and Express.js with the following libraries:

bcrypt: for hashing passwords,
connect-flash: for flash messages,
cookie-parser: for parsing cookies,
dotenv: for environment variable management,
express-handlebars: for templating,
express-session: for session management,
jsonwebtoken: for handling JSON Web Tokens,
